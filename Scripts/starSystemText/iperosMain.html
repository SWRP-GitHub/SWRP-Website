            </h3>
            <p1><i>The Iperos System</i> houses a red giant star, which falls outside of the traditional letter
                classifications for
                celestial bodies.</p1>
            <h3>Digios and Laramas, Foremost Orbits<br><img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/iperos/digios.png" alt="Digios"
                    style="width:50px;height:50px;"> <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/iperos/laramas.png" alt="Larmas"
                    style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>Two scorched, inhabitable rocks circle closely to the burning red sun. Early settlers of the sector
                theorized that ancient civilizations once thrived on these hypothetically vibrant worlds, but in reality
                these are
                mere unfounded legends told to pass the time. The <i>Iperos star</i> expanded long before the sector was
                ever
                settled,
                burning away any traces of life that may have populated these worlds. Travel to these scorched former
                planets is
                inadvisable, and would be lethal for most sentients without protective suits. Even starships may find
                themselves
                succumbing should they fly too close to this system's sun, should they not be fitted with suitable solar
                shielding.</p1>
            <h3>Kilius, Third Orbit<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/iperos/kilius.png" alt="Kilius"
                    style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>The heart of the <i>Sapius Corporation’s</i> mining operations in the sector. The desolate surface of
                <i>Kilius</i>,
                similar
                to its sister planets closer yet to the blazing red sun, has been scorched barren, albeit to a lesser
                extreme.
                Still, standing on the planetary surface without protective gear would be suicide for most species.
                <br><br>
                <i>The Kilius Installation:</i> A massive, solar shielded mining structure sits on the planet's
                surface,
                though most of <i>Sapius’</i> expansion has been downward into the depths of <i>Kilius</i>. <i>The
                    Kilius Installation</i> acts
                as
                <i>Sapius’</i> mining hub. Though there are several sites across the planetary surface, travel between
                them is done
                completely beneath the surface through burrowed tunnels. Magnetic guided trains carry large quantities
                of
                unrefined spice through these tunnels from the various dig sites to the main Installation. A massive
                underground
                hanger dug into a preexisting cavern ships out large quantities of unrefined spice daily on
                <i>Sapius</i>
                transports.
                The mines themselves run deep, and are worked by an army of Imperial prisoners and slave droids.
            </p1>
            <h3>Iperos, Fourth Orbit<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/iperos/iperos.png" alt="Iperos"
                    style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>The headquarters of the <i>Sapius Corporation</i>. A large, mostly oceanic world, with large swaths of
                sea water
                covering its expansive surface.
                <i>Iperos</i> frequently feels the heat from the system's massive sun, causing most planetary life to
                adapt and
                retreat
                far below the cold oceanic depths. Dried coral islands occasionally spot the surface of the world,
                though in
                terms of natural rock formations, not much can be found. When the <i>Empire</i> first came to the
                sector, deep
                ocean
                oil drilling was attempted for about a year, with little success. <i>The Sapius Corporation</i> came
                soon after,
                building a massive metallic surface hub above the abandoned drill sites.
                <br><br>
                <i>The Sapius Corporation:</i>
                <p1> When the <i>Empire</i> came to the Sector, so did their businesses. <i>Sapius</i> was started by a
                    coreworld
                    entrepreneur
                    willing to sell his soul, seeking <i>Imperial</i> financing to start a business and turn a profit.
                    Early in the
                    <i>Empire’s</i> scouting of the Sector, trace veins of <i2>Sansanna spice</i2> were discovered on
                    the desolate surface
                    of
                    the planet <i>Kilius</i>. As the nearby <i>Marjora System</i> was heavily colonized by citizens and
                    armies of the
                    <i>Galactic
                        Empire</i>, the shining new headquarters of one of the galaxy's newest corporations sprouted out
                    from the
                    seas
                    of <i>Iperos</i>.
                    A sizable private army has been build by Sapius to protect their own interests, despite them falling
                    under
                    the mantel of the <i>Galactic Empire</i>.
                </p1>
                <br><br>
                <i>The Iperos Installation:</i>
                <p1>The gigantic shining structure in the vast oceans of <i>Iperos</i> acts as <i>Sapius
                        Corporation's</i> main
                            headquarters.
                            The Installation stands out of the sea triumphantly, with massive defense systems and
                            landing pads built
                            onto its surface. The majority of <i>Sapius’ Corporate</i> business offices rise in
                            individual towers from the
                            top
                            of the installation. Down below the water level, the <i2>Sansanna spice</i2> refinery
                            purifies the product mined
                            on
                            nearby <i>Kilius</i>. Once undergoing refinement, transports disperse it across the sector,
                            and the greater
                            galaxy.
                            On paper, the spice is refined for medical products, though the nature of the business
                            ensures some of
                            the
                            spice falls into the hands of sentients to be used for illicit purposes. </p1>
                <h3>Potential Roleplaying opportunities:</h3>
                <p1> The massive <i>Iperos Installation</i> acts as a corporate hub for the sector. Characters
                    journeying to this
                    technological wonder may be acting under the employ of <i>Sapius</i>, or perhaps, their current
                    leash-holders,
                    the
                    <i>Galactic Empire</i>. Alternatively, independent <i>smugglers</i> or <i>criminals</i> may seek to
                    pirate unrefined spice on
                    its
                    way into the factory. Covert rebels and members of the <i>New Republic</i> may take an interest in
                    the
                    corporation’s handling of slave labor on nearby <i>Kilius</i>. Or, the <i>Empire’s</i> slow
                    pollution and lack of
                    preservation of the beautiful seas of <i>Iperos</i>.
                    Beneath the waves of <i>Sapius’ headquarters</i>, the automated refinery casts a metaphorical shadow
                    over the
                    shining beacon that is the <i>Iperos Installation</i>. Long tubes carry waste materials far from the
                    Installation,
                    polluting the southern seas. It’s only a matter of time before corporate renegades, or perhaps the
                    natural
                    order of things, begin to turn on <i>Sapius</i>.
