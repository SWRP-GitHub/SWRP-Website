      <h1>Imperial Remnant of Region Twelve</h1>
      <p1
        >Led by the blusterous <i>Governor Terrier Ryehall</i>, the
        <i>Imperial Remnant</i> that hold control over
        <i>Region Twelve</i> makes its presence known throughout the systems.
        From various <i>Imperial Garrisons</i> on planets to the large
        <i>Star Destroyer Decadence</i> that sits above <i>Marjora City</i>, you
        would be hard pressed not to feel the looming shadow of Imperial
        authority wherever you are in Region Twelve.<br /><br />
        The recent assassination attempt on the life of Governor Ryehall has
        caused the <i>Imperial Forces</i> to begin locking down the region, the
        Decadence rests above Marjora City as a show of force. Ships coming into
        Region Twelve submit to imperial scans or face the consequences.<br /><br />
        <i>The Imperial Navy</i> is enough to maintain security and patrols and
        keep a lid on threats from within the Region, but they rely on their
        isolation from the rest of the galaxy to avoid any major conflict. The
        Decadence is the flagship of the Imperial Navy in Region Twelve, as it
        is the only Star Destroyer they have.<br /><br />
        What happened in your character's career to get them sent to Region
        Twelve as a post, it's far from a prestigious station? Did they fight in
        <i>the Galactic Civil War</i>? Players looking to join the
        <i>Imperial forces</i> have a plethora of options to them, ranging from
        ground forces to a naval captain and anywhere in between.</p1
