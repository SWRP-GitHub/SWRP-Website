      <h1>The New Republic Presence in Region Twelve</h1>
      <p1>
        Presence of the burgeoning <i>New Republic</i> in such an isolated part of the
        galaxy's fringes is incredibly limited to say the least. Dealing with a
        plethora of issues at locations of higher importance, <i>Region Twelve</i> has
        flown under the radar of the New Republic's higher authorities. A few
        operatives have made their way to the distant region of space, but
        little has come of their efforts.<br /><br />
    <i>Porter Creal</i>, one such operator, led an attempt to destabilize the
        region by assassinating <i>Governor Ryehall</i> but was caught before he was
        allowed to finish the mission. His actions sparked a paranoia in the
    <i>Imperial leadership</i> of Region Twelve and what few operatives remained
        across the various star systems in this pocket of space have gone to
        ground.<br /><br />
        Before his death, Porter Creal believed his mission would be a success
        and a transmission was sent through backwater channels to <i>Hosnian Prime</i>,
        requesting more support. A small budget was approved for New Republic
        operatives to make their way to Region Twelve, but military forces
        cannot be supported at this time. It is up to these few operatives that
        are scattered around the system, or running the blockade to make their
        way into Region Twelve, to turn the tide of imperial influence.<br /><br />
        How did your character get involved with the New Republic? Did they
        fight in <i>the Galactic Civil War</i>? Players looking to join the New
        Republic faction are fighting an uphill battle, one that will require
        patience, subterfuge, and the courage to fight the <i>Empire</i>.
