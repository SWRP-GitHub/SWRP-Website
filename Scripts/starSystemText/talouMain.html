        <h1>Talou System</h1><p1>
        Talou is the furthest from Marjora of all solar systems in Region Twelve. It's distance and wealth of natural
        resources made it a good place to set up factories, manufacturing plants, and prison labor.

        <h3>Talou I:</h3> A hot, desert planet. Small outposts have been constructed across the planet's surface to mine
        the rich resources hidden just beneath the crust of the plant. Most of these mines are still in working
        condition, though many have been claimed by different gangs after the Imperial forces retreated.

        <h3>Talou II:</h3> A barren saltland planet. Prospectors theorize that the entirety of the planet was once
        covered by vast oceans until a large asteroid collided with the planet's surface. A large scar sits in on the
        planets surface where the remains of the asteroid can be found. Imperial prison labor camps have been set up to
        mine the asteroid debris, and like those on Talou I, many have since been taken over by gangs. A breathing
        apparatus is required on this planet, as the air is toxic to those that breathe oxygen.

        <h3>Talou III:</h3> Talou III is the heart of Region Twelve's prison industrial complex. The Empire set up a
        large shanty city to house a substantial population of prisoners, imported from various regions of the
        surrounding galaxy. Overtime, control of the city degraded due to the rapidly expanding scope of the project. By
        6 ABY, the Empire had mostly ceded control to a private security company. By 9 ABY, corruption had spread
        through the city entire and Shai-Don Security proved to be inept at keeping the situation under control. After a
        violent outburst, the prisoners have seized full control of the city. Now, everyone holds their breath to see
        how the Imperial Government of the region responds.

        <h3>Potential Roleplaying Opportunities:</h3> Talou I and Talou II maintain their wealth due to the natural
        resources of the planet. Plenty of abandoned facilities could provide cover for those looking for a base of
        operations, or for an entrepreneur looking to kickstart a potential fortune, if they can fend off the gangs
        willing to contest the planet's bounties. Talou III is a major hub of criminal activity in Region Twelve. Anyone
        who wants to start a grand heist, or find skilled criminal labor, goes to Talou III.</p1>
