        <p1>The star of <i>Acherios</i>
            is a weak white dwarf. The system was deemed to be of little
            exploitable value by the <i>Empire</i>
            during initial surveys. A large asteroid field sits in between the
            star and
            the orbit of the closes planet.</p1>

        <p1>The first planet in the orbit of the star,<i>Acherios I</i>
            is an ocean world. Most of the
            minimal settlement that the solar system has seen can be found near the equator of the planet aboard
            floating towns. Fishing is the primary export of the <i>Acherios System</i>
            and its these fishing towns that
            provide the services. Most fishing villages have a single freighter to transport goods in and out of the
            town, and an empty landing pad to fit incoming vessels. The water near the poles of the planet are
            unstable,
            ranging from mountainous waves to long stretches of ice and frozen glaciers.</p1>

        <p1>This arctic planet lies in a far orbit of the star. Sparse townships exist only near
            the few forests that have somehow survived the harsh conditions of the planet. The settlers are a hardy
            folk
            with little taste for outsiders. There is a dark secret here however, the ruins of a temple dedicated to
            the
            teaching of <i>Sith</i>
            is hidden somewhere on the planet, kept a secret by the dark acolytes that tend to
            the
            ruins. The secrets that remain here in the rubble are yet to be discovered.</p1>

        <p1>Acherios is where most of the <i>Sith</i>
            that find themselves in
            <i>Region Twelve</i>
            will trace their origin to, and any that might look to retrace their steps to find any
            secrets
            left in the wake of the temple's burning will find themselves back here.
