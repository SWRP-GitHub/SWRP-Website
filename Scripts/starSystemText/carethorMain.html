                <h3>Carethor:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/carethor/carethor.png" alt="Carethor" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
                <p1>Initially skipped over during the initial surveys done by the </p1><i>Empire</i>
                <p1> when Region Twelve was scouted,</p1>
                <i>Carethor</i>
                <p1> later became the singular attention for the </p1>
                <i>Peranno Research Institute</i>
                <p1>. They accepted a grant from the </p1>
                <i>Empire</i>
                <p1> to establish a research instillation in orbit of the only planet in the system.</p1>

                <i>Carethor</i>
                <p1> is a large gas giant that orbits incredibly slowly around the system's single star. It is estimated
                    that the gas giant completes one revolution around the star every twenty three years. In orbit
                    around
                    the gas giant are a series of moons as well as the </p1>
                <i>Peranno Installation</i>
                <p1>, a space station that is well stocked, sustainable, and focused entirely on researching the gas
                    giant.
                    Due to the nature of their research, a private security has been hired to keep people away from the
                    station.</p1>
                <i>Carethor</i>
                <p1> boasts four moons, all in varying levels of habitability.</p1>

            <h3>Bralast:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/carethor/bralast.png" alt="Barlast" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>The moon of </p1><i>Bralast</i>
            <p1> is the smallest of all the moons in orbit of</p1> <i>Carethor</i>
            <p1>, but despite this, it is the most habitable. Settlers on </p1>

            <i>Bralast</i>
            <p1> have established an easy life, enjoying the lush splendor of the moon's jungles and rivers. They
                will
                trade often with the </p1>
            <i>Peranno Installation</i>
            <p1> for credits and other pieces of technology.</p1>

            <h3>Bronesh:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/carethor/bronesh.png" alt="Bronesh" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>This moon, if you could call it that, is barely more than an asteroid that rockets
                around
                <i>Carethor</i> at a blistering speed. The first thing done by the <i>Peranno Research
                    Institute</i>,
                was calculate
                the
                celestial body's orbital path to ensure that it would not collide with their station. Projections
                estimate
                that <i>Bronesh</i> will collide with <i>Halish</i> in <i>one hundred and three years</i>.

            <h3>Halish:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/carethor/halish.png" alt="Halish" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>Settlers of <i>Halish</i> make ample use of Halish's slow orbit around <i>Carethor</i> to exploit
                the
                constant torrent of sunlight from the star. Large amounts of the desert moon's land has been
                converted
                into
                vast solar farms. These power cells are shipped out across Region Twelve. Due to an incredibly thin
                atmosphere, a breathing apparatus is required here.</p1>

            <h3>Paramis:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/carethor/paramis.png" alt="Paramis" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>The largest of <i>Carethor's moons</i> boasts high mountains and deep craters. Temperatures
                fluctuate wildly on the planet's surface and intense rainstorms have stagnated colonization progress
                on
                the
                moon. What wildlife has made its home here has shown incredible hostility to settlers, and what few
                folk
                have remained in the moon have taken to settling within the caves of the moon as a means to avoid
                the
                weather and wildlife.</p1>

            <h3>Potential Roleplaying Opportunities:</h3>
            <p1>There are a number of reasons one could find themselves
                coming
                to <i>Carethor</i>. Those with scientific aptitude could find themselves in the employ of <i>the
                    Peranno
                    Installation</i>.
                <i>Thieves</i> and <i>splicers</i> could find quite a pretty credit stealing secrets from the
                reclusive
                scientists as
                well. One seeking fame and fortune could find themselves on <i>Paramis</i>, hunting a creature of
                great
                renown.
                Or
                perhaps you're looking to disrupt the flow of energy in <i>Region Twelve</i>, <i>Halish</i> is a
                prime
                target.
