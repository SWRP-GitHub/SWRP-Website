      <h1>The Fragmented Sith</h1>
      <p1
        >A product of one of the many schemes of <i>Darth Vader</i>, <i>The Fragmented
        Sith</i> were created by <i>Miraxces Uduun</i> as a secret plan to undermine the
      <i>Emperor</i>. The <i>Acolyte of the Beyond</i> was sent to the far reaches of <i>Region
        Twelve</i> before <i>Imperial forces</i> began to settle the systems; to evaluate,
        assess, and raise an <i>order of Sith</i> to be called on at a later time.
        <br /><br />
        An idea that is good in theory, however the <i>Galactic Civil War</i> took
        Vader's attention far away from Region Twelve and Miraxces Uduun was
        left to his own devices, training the would be Sith as best as he could.
      <i>Force Sensitive children</i> were kidnapped from the various planets of
        Region Twelve, selected at a young age to be raised in the way of the
        Sith.
        <br /><br />
        Those that proved merit were given <i>Kyber crystals</i> to bleed, harvested
        from the aftermath of <i>Order 66</i>, and instructed on how to build their own
      <i>Lightsaber</i>. Not many reached this step, most were culled from the
        extensive testing and training led by Uduun. By <i>8 ABY</i>, the members of
        the Order began to test the limits of their extreme isolation, the
        dominos began to fall and during <i>9 ABY</i>, the Order broke apart as a few
        believed themselves strong enough to no longer need Uduun. The <i>Sith
        Temple</i> was burned and The Fragmented Sith were born. 
        <br /><br />
        What are your character's goals now that they are free of Uduun's
        tutelage? Will they return to <i>Acherios</i> to salvage what they can from the
        ruins of the Sith Temple, will they strike out on their own in Region
        Twelve, or will they look for others like them to mend the shattered
        pieces of their fragmented Sith Order? Players looking to join the
        Fragmented Sith will find themselves unleashed into Region Twelve with
        many options before them. It is up to them to decide what they do with
        their learned power.</p1
