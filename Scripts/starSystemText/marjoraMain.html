    <h1>Marjora System: <img src="../../Maps/starIcons/whiteDwarf.png" alt="White Dwarf Star" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h1>
    <p1><i>Marjora</i> and its seven planets make up the capital system of <i>Region Twelve</i>. The focus of <i>Imperial</i> colonization
        has
        proven to be a smashing success.</p1>
    </div><div>
    <h3>Marjora I: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/marjora1.png" alt="Marjora I" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
    <p1> An otherwise desolate world with its surface scoured by the proximity to the nearby sun. It has earned it's
        nickname of <i>"The Sea of Glass"</i> due to large sections of the planet being mostly made of superheated and
        crystallized
        glass. The planet was the site of two <i>Imperial</i> research facilities that have otherwise been abandoned due to the
        untenable living conditions of the planet. A large solar flare necessitated a quick evacuation of those
        facilities,
        who knows what treasures they left behind?</p1>

    <h3>Marjora II: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/marjora2.png" alt="Marjora II" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
    <p1> A dense forest world with a single moon. <i>Marjora II</i> is currently the company headquarters of <i>Ashion
        Agriculture</i>,
        one of the companies involved in the settling of <i>Region Twelve</i>. Large sections of forest have been carved out by
        the
        corporate authorities to create company towns. </p1>

    <h3>Marjora III: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/marjora3.png" alt="Marjora III" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
    <p1>Also known as <i>Marjora Prime</i>, this planet is the capital of <i>Region Twelve</i>. <i>Marjora Prime</i> is a terrestrial planet,
        with large regions of forest, mountains, and ocean. The capital city is surrounded on three sides by a mountain
        range that has been nicknamed <i>'The Marjora Bowl'</i>. The city itself sports dense company housing near the
        outskirts,
        to meet the working demands of the factories. Large government buildings make up the center of the city.
        Currently,
        the Imperial Star Destroyer <i>Decadence</i>, rests above the city, casting a large shadow on the people below. On the
        three moons of <i>Marjora Prime</i>, one would find mining outposts supported by light <i>imperial</i> garrisons. </p1>
    </div><div>
    <h3>Asteroid Belt: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/astroidBelt.png" alt="Astroid Belt" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
    <p1> In between <i>Marjora Prime</i> and <i>Marjora IV</i>, a large asteroid belt wraps around the system. It proved to be a
        valuable
        region for independent mining.</p1>
    </div><div>
    <h3>Marjora IV: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/marjora4.png" alt="Marjora IV" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
    <p1>Colder temperatures are found this far out in the system. The original candidate for the capital of the system,
        however the better conditions of <i>Marjora III</i> were chosen instead. Now the host to a handful of pirate gangs,
    <i>Marjora
        IV</i> is truly an arctic badlands.</p1>

    <h3>Marjora V: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/marjora5.png" alt="Marjora V" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
    <p1>A ball of ice in space, completely frozen over. A few deep ice mining stations can be found here and there, but
        otherwise it is a desolate place. If someone were looking for refuge in the <i>Marjora</i> system, there are few places
        better than <i>Marjora V</i></p1>

    <h3>Marjora VI: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/marjora6.png" alt="Marjora VI" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
    <p1>On the outskirts of the system, the sunlight that reaches <i>Marjora VI</i> holds little warmth. Sporadic volcanic
        activity
        keeps the planet of interest to <i>Imperial scientists</i>, but otherwise it holds little value to the system.</p1>

    <h3>Marjora VII: <img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/marjora/marjora7.png" alt="Marjora VII" style="width:30px;height:30px;"></h3>
    <p1>Barely larger than a planetoid, the furthest planet in the Marjora system would be nearly worthless were it not
        for
        the few <i>Imperial</i> garrisons that can be found here. <i>Research Facilities</i> and a refueling stations for ships coming
        and
        going from the system keep <i>Marjora VII</i> in the lens of the Empire.</p1>
