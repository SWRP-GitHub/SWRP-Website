            <h1>The Jedi Wanderers</h1>
            <p1>Decades before the dark eye of the Galactic Empire ever turned to Region Twelve, there were Jedi
                wandering
                the
                systems that formed it. These initial guardians of peace had left the Republic alongside a group of
                religious
                devotees from the Church of the Force, hoping to guide the pilgrims safely to a new home. Inus Daxio and
                Malic
                Tedronius, Master and Apprentice, originally set their course towards a legendary mountain of kyber
                their
                passengers had seen in shared visions. As the years went by however, and the existence of such a
                mountain
                was
                verified, their will to stay in the sector grew along with the burgeoning Region Twelve.
                <br><br>
                For years, Jedi Master Inus Daxio trained two padawans on the slopes of Mount Matur, on the elusive
                seventh
                moon
                of Kiida. Malic Tedronius was the first, a pupil the High Council on Coruscant had assigned to him. The
                second
                was a student he had picked up on the nearby planet Vaedas, Aireen Sanarra, the son of the King and
                former
                heir
                to the throne. Eventually, his two pupils would become Jedi Knights, together protecting the region as
                an
                unstoppable force of good.
                <br><br>
                Their light however could only shine so bright while there was little darkness to challenge them.
                Everything
                changed when the Empire’s shadow was cast across the galaxy. The galactic superpower’s hatred and need
                to
                consume would eventually spread to this faraway region. First came the Inquisitors, looking for the Jedi
                rumored
                to protect the nearby worlds. Then came the Sith themselves.
                <br><br>
                Master Daxio was slaughtered by Darth Vader on the planet Vaedas, along with a great number of his
                allies.
                The
                silver lining for Daxio, as he lay in the snow and blood, was that by sacrificing himself he had
                protected
                the
                secret of Mount Matur and the existence of his students who had found refuge there.
                <br><br>
                Malic Tedronius, former protector of the region, would pass the following years in a self sentenced
                exile on
                Kiida VII. Despite his self attributed failures, he still relented to the wishes of the members of the
                Church of
                the Force when force sensitive adepts showed up seeking training. For another generation, Malic
                represented
                one
                of the last of the old Order as he brought up a number of pupils. His students, after leaving Kiida,
                would
                protect their new home as forces of darkness continued to spread, the light and the dark continuing
                their
                eternal battle for supremacy even in this remote region.
                <br><br>
                Eventually, Malic’s exile would end, and he’d once again leave to wander the stars, protecting the
                innocents
                still plagued by the lingering darkness. A few of his students would take up his mantle and safeguard
                Mount
                Matur, while others would begin the training of new padawans across Sector Twelve. Those called to by
                the
                force,
                the few who see Mount Matur in their dreams, now seek the Jedi and their allies out across the stars in
                hopes of
                getting their hands on one of the few Jedi Wayfinders.

                        that

                <h2>Jedi Wanderers Today:</h2>

                The students trained by Malic Tedronius still safeguard Region Twelve, creating relationships with its
                people by
                walking among them. While no official and completely organized Jedi Order has yet to be formed, the
                Kiida
                System
                serves as a safe haven for younger initiate's and padawan's training. Other young adepts learn from
                active
                Wanderers, studying the ways of the force as they travel across the Region. Jedi hopefuls still seek out
                the
                Jedi and their affiliates across the stars, in an attempt to find one of the elusive Wayfinders and
                eventually
                make their own way to the kyber mountain.
