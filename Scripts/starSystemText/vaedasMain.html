                    style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>

            <p1>A small temperate planet, with much of its surface filled with shallow mountains and wintry forests. The
                wild
                nature of this cold world’s fauna has been kept at bay by human civilization for over <i>two thousand
                    years</i>,
                since
                sentient life first made the pilgrimage to this remote sector during the waning years of the <i>Old
                    Republic</i>.

                The people of <i>Vaedas</i> elected to create a <i>monarchist dynasty</i>, where local Lords and Ladys
                could closely watch
                over the interests of their rural constituents. Typically, the realm as a whole has sworn their
                allegiances
                to
                one family in particular, whoever can hold the mighty and majestic fortress known as the <i>Westreach
                    Spires</i>.

            <h3><i>Notable features:</i></h3>
            <p1>Regal castles, towering fortresses, and remote villages can be found scattered across
                the desolate surface of <i>Vaedas</i>. Technology progressed slowly, with most of the changes slowly
                built on
                designs
                and schematics from back when the future settlers of <i>Vaedas</i> first left the <i>Old Republic</i>.
            </p1>
            
            <p1>
                <h3><i>Notable established locations:</i></h3>
                <p2><i>Haan:</i></p2> Capital city of <i>Vaedas</i>. A defensible, walled city, which for the short
                period of time
                <i>Vaedas</i> was
                occupied by the <i>Empire</i> served as their planetary headquarters.
                <br><br>
                <p2><i>Tynean Spaceport:</i></p2> The only public spaceport on <i>Vaedas</i>. Since the Empire has been
                vanquished
                from <i>Vaedas</i>,
                outsiders are once again looked towards hostility. Because of this, the <i>Imperial-built</i> landing
                facility
                hasn’t
                gotten much use in recent years. In order to land at this facility unimpeded, one must have strong
                relations
                with the people of <i>Vaedas</i>.
                <br><br>
                <p2><i>Imperial Bastion:</i></p2> The heart (or cancer, depending on one's allegiances), in the center
                of
                <i>Haan</i> during the
                <i>Empire’s</i> occupation of the planet. During the <i>Culling of Haan</i>, loyalist monarchist forces
                who’d sworn their
                lives to <i>House Sanarra</i> broke into the bastion, massacring many of the <i>Imperial</i> forces
                stationed here.
                <br><br>
                <p2><i>Westreach Spires:</i></p2> An impressive stone and steel castle several klicks outside of the
                city of
                <i>Haan</i>. The
                castle has stood atop a steady slope for twenty generations, always acting as the ruling seat for the
                <i>King
                    of
                    the Realm</i>. Many a bloody battle has been fought at its feet, though it's rarely been breached.

            <h3>Historical Account:</h3>

            <p2><i>~2500 BBY:</i></p2> <p1>Dissident families from monarchies across the Republic banded together for a
            journey into the
            unknown. Equipped with vessels filled with building supplies, livestock, and a host of settlers, the group
            that
            would eventually become the people of Vaedas charted a course in secret to a planet far from the greater
            galaxy
            where they could live in peace. They eventually settled on Vaedas.
            <br><br>
            <p2><i>159 BBY:</i></p2> A long, planetary wide civil war between rival factions finally ended when House
            Sanarra lay
            siege to Westreach Spires, forcing the former ruling power to surrender the future of the realm to their
            family's rule.
            <br><br>
            <p2><i>40 BBY:</i></p2> The Battle of the Vortex: A pair of Jedi escorting religious devotees to the Daijax
            Nebula were
            forced down on Vaedas after their vessel sustained damage in the Andalu Cluster. The Jedi initially faced a
            hostile army led by the militant King of Vaedas, Lord Tynean Sanarra, though after a spectacular display a
            peace
            agreement was brokered between the two parties.
            <br><br>
            <p2><i>13 BBY:</i></p2> The Night of the Scarlet Sword: A scout visited Vaedas as a part of an Imperial
            expansion
            project. A sole figure, the Dark Lord of the Sith and apprentice to the Emperor himself, Darth Vader. There,
            Vader was attacked by the unified forces of Jedi Master Inus Daxio and Lord Tynean Sanarra, as well as the
            full
            force of the Vaedas calvary. Both of the great leaders and warriors who opposed the shadowy armored sith
            fell,
            along with many of the soldiers of Vaedas.
            *Following the death of Tynean Sanarra, his son, Aireen, took the throne.
            <br><br>
            <p2><i>10 BBY:</i></p2> Imperials came to Vaedas in numbers, securing the capital city of the realm, Haan,
            as their
            stronghold. After a series of devastating battles now referred to as The Subjugation of Vaedas, recently
            crowned
            King Aireen Sanarra was forced to surrender control of the fiercely independent realm to the armies of the
            Galactic Empire.
            <br><br>
            <p2><i>5 ABY:</i></p2> The Culling of Haan: After 15 years of Imperial rule, a dissident army led by King
            Aireen Sanarra
            attacked the city of Haan. The local Imperial regiment had been thinned out following the major loss over
            the
            forest moon of Endor. Any Imperial and offworlder the Vaedas forces were able to find was struck down. The
            survivors fled, and the Empire did not return in the following years.
            Despite Aireen never losing the title of King, the formerly united people of Vaedas who once lived under the
            banner of House Sanarra now find themselves split into multiple rival factions. Many powerful Houses now
            find
            themselves doubting Aireen Sanarra, as it was he who was first forced to bend the knee to the Empire.

            <h3>Potential Roleplaying Opportunities:</h3>
            Life on <i>Vaedas</i> is cold and hard. Fierce beasts prowl the faraway mountains, including packs of deadly
            <i>vask
                wolves</i> and, if one were to find themselves incredibly unlucky, <i>menagerie dragons</i>.

            <i>Vaedas</i> is seen by many as a land out of time, due to their isolationism. Technology has progressed
            relatively
            slowly compared with the rest of the galaxy. <i>Lavish vibroswords</i> are passed from generation to
            generation.
            <i>Long,
                ornate hunting rifles</i> that have slain mighty beasts hang above familial hearths. Death to the wilds
            of
            <i>Vaedas</i> is
            commonplace, so many poor farming communities raise a plethora of offspring to compensate.
