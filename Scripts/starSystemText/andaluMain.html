            </h1>
            <i>The Andalu Cluster</i>
            <p1>is nearly an untouched frontier, a grouping of potentially
                settleable star systems on the far edge of the </p1><i>Daijax Nebula</i>
            <p1>. Unlike the other major systems in </p1><i>Region
                Twelve</i>
            <p1>,</p1><i>
                the Andalu Cluster</i>
            <p1>is made up of several small burning stars once formed within the greenish blue</p1><i> Daijax
                Nebula</i>
            <p1>,
                each of which now sit just outside of the soupy veil.

                Space debris is also frequently churned out of the nebula, making travel through</p1><i> the Andalu
                Cluster</i>
            <p1>
                particularly
                dangerous. In addition to creating space navigation difficult, this steady flow of rock and ice will
                often
                collide with the planets within </p1><i>the Andalu Cluster</i>
            <p1>, leaving pockmarks and craters behind.</p1>

            <h3>Ryne, Andalu's First Star</h3>
            <h3>Ryne I:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/andalu/ryne1.png" alt="Ryne I" style="width:55px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1> A massive purple gas giant, remarked for the beautiful patterns that ripple across its
                surface.</p1>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Ryne II:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/andalu/ryne2.png" alt="Ryne II" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>A small volcanic world with ashen skies. Wide rivers of molten lava and eternally burning
                forests make this an especially inhospitable environment. A few elevated platforms were built above
                the
                fiery
                world early during the</p1>><i>Empire's</i>
            <p1>occupation of Sector Twelve as Walker production sites. The effort
                was
                quickly
                abandoned however, as transporting the manufactured AT-ATs, AT-STs, and other Imperial hardware
                through the
                treacherous </p1><i>Andalu Cluster</i>
            <p1> became too costly.
                <br><br>
                The toxic atmosphere is unsafe to breathe for long periods of time, making oxygen regulation masks a
                necessity
                whilst out in the elements.

            <h3>Voxes I:<img src="../../Maps/planetIcons/andalu/voxes1.png" alt="Voxes I" style="width:50px;height:50px;"></h3>
            <p1>A large world with foreboding forests. The trees of </p1><i>Voxes I</i>
            <p1> are so massive, they completely
                blot
                out any light from reaching the forest floor far below, creating a perma-night for the nocturnal
                creatures
                that
                consider the dark forest home.</p1>
            <br><br>
            <i>Smugglers</i>
            <p1> and small exploration operations have been known to make the large treetops home,
                balancing large
                wooden landing pads between the tree's mighty branches.

            <p1>An oblong conglomerate of ice and stone, formed centuries ago within the </p1><i>Daijax Nebula</i>
            <p1> and
                now
                locked in orbit around the star of</p1><i> Nilline</i>

                I</i>
            <p1>, as the
                nearby nebula is seen as a source of virtually untapped natural resources. Precious minerals within
            </p1><i>Nilline
                I</i>
            <p1>, as well as some often found exiting the nebula, are mined for their worth and dispersed throughout

            <p1>A dark world, with twilight skies. Bioluminescent growth creeps out of deep crevices,
                which
                open up into massive caves far below the planetary surface. Deep dwellers, such as massive space
                slugs, are
                rumored to reside within the rocks of </p1><i>Nilline II</i>
