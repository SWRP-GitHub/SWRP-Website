        <h1>Tressia System</h1>
        <p1>Tressia's star has long since died. The <i>Imperial Survey Corps</i> estimate that the star went
            supernova before the time of the <i>High Republic</i>. The star has since collapsed on itself, turning into a black
            hole. Curiously, the empty space around the event horizon of the black hole made it the prime candidate for
            several space stations. Travelers approaching the system will receive current astronavigation charts to
            ensure
            that they have the safest route to any of the ports that call Tressia home.

            <h3>Solanis Scrapyard and Repairs:</h3> Owned by an eccentric Ugnaught, Solanis Scrapyard and Repairs
            provides
            the highest quality salvaging and maintenance service in Region Twelve. Sure, you could go anywhere else,
            but no
            one gives those touch ups quite like <i>Solanis</i>. Just don't make him angry or your ship could find itself
            slipping
            past Tressia's event horizon.

            <h3>Port of No Return:</h3> Looking for a place to lay low and forget who you are? Look no further than the
            Port
            of No Return. Offering lodging, drinks, questionable food, and a <i>seedy black market</i> of wares, any smuggler
            and
            lowlife worth anything in Region Twelve has some reason to visit this space station from time to time.

            <h3>Nebula Runner's Racing:</h3> Perhaps you're more into the business of pushing whatever ship you're
            flying to
            its limits, maxing out the potential of your sublight thrusters and leaving everyone in the dust. Then
            Nebula
            Runner's Racing is your place to be. There's no better premier racing found in Region Twelve than the daring
            tracks setup by the Twi'lek twins.

            <h3>Imperial Survey Corps, Wayfinder Station:</h3> Critical to the settling of Region Twelve, the Imperial
            Survey Corps set up shop on the outskirts of the <i>Daijax Nebula</i>. They keep the astronavigation charts up to
            date
            and assist vessels attempting to pass through the dense space of the black hole.
