        <h1>The Five Points System</h1>
        <p1><i>The Five Points system</i> serves as a scarcely settled waypoint between some of the larger systems in <i>Sector
        Twelve</i>. Quite simply, the system is named after its notable five celestial bodies, or Points, of interest.
        Initially settled as a resupplying location for interstellar travelers, it now hosts shelter for those who wish
        to start a new life, or for those who desire to be left alone. As the <i>Empire</i> and <i>Sapius Corporation</i> attempt to
        expand their grasp, there are many willing to fight to keep the Five Points as much of an untouched frontier as
        possible.

        <h3>Point One, Hyl Candora</h3>
        The <i>abnormal</i> and <i>abstract geological formations</i> of Hyl Candora have attracted geologists and archaeologists from
        across the galaxy since Sector Twelve’s colonization by the Galactic Empire. Impossibly tall lattices of stone
        climb high into the sky, bridging over the planet in magnificent fashion. <i>Wild alien life</i> and <i>fantastical storms</i>
        make this unique world even more of a wonder to behold.
        <br>
        <i>Construct Canyons:</i> Some of the natural structures have such distinct shapes that the more superstitious
        offworlders have come to theorize that this world was quite literally crafted by some massive, unknown
        extraterrestrial being. A monster, or god, crafting the planet to their liking.

        <h3>Point Two, New Granan</h3>
        A <i>sunken</i>, <i>swampy marshland</i> planet with a number of outposts dotting across its many bogs and jungles.
        Settlements first popped up on New Granan as a potential middle point between some of Sector Twelve’s further
        systems. As settlements grew, many farmers and ranchers came to New Granan to make use of the damp lands.
        <br><br>
        <i>Kol Saka:</i> The <i>largest settlement</i> in the Five Points System, and acting political center. Built over a
        flat swamp on New Granan, bridges and raised walkways keep civilians out of the mud as they walk from building
        to building. <i>The Five Point Marshals</i>, the system's frontier sheriff agency, are headquartered here. Outlaws and
        gangsters often simply refer to them as the Marshals. The System’s political authority, <i>the Five Point
        Pentarchy</i>, also is based out of the sizable swamp town. The Pentarchy is made up of five shadowy individuals,
        each of which represent the interests of one of the system's Points.
        <br><br>
        <i>Kol Weave:</i> An outpost deep in the <i>jungles</i> of New Granan. Armed convoys frequently travel in and out of
        this point, but what they carry no one knows.

        <h3>Point Three, Kamorus</h3>
        A <i>tiny moon</i> orbiting New Granan, Kamorus acts as a fertile extension to the swamp world’s farming enterprises.
        Vivid, colorful vegetation grows in the wilds here, separated from the small farming communities by high powered
        electric barriers.

        <h3>Point Four, Taphin</h3>
        Taphin is a recently founded colony world for those trying to escape the more hectic <i>Marjora</i> system. Initially a
        project started by the <i>Galactic Empire’s</i> expansion efforts, control of the colony has since transferred to the
        Five Point Pentarchy on nearby New Granan.

        Taphin is characterized by its fields of <i>golden grass</i> and short <i>savanna trees</i>.

        <h3>Point Five, Athus</h3>
        A bleak, rocky wasteland. Aside from a few shallow canyons and divots, (and, most notably, <i>The Pit</i>) the surface
        of Athus is remarkably <i>flat</i> and <i>void of life</i>. Massive mining crawlers belonging to the <i>Sapius Corporation</i> can be
        seen from a distance, as can the company’s occasional storage facility.
        <br><br><i>The Pit:</i> A gigantic hole dug deep into the planet, visible from orbit. A city has formed in the
        crater, lining the sides of it with businesses, hangars, and public facilities. While initially dug as an
        industrial endeavor, casinos, hotels, and slums now line the rim and edges. The upper districts, which see the
        light of day for longer periods of time, tend to be where wealthier tourists and prominent figures reside. The
        lower levels, which more visibly bear the Pit’s industrial past, tend to be riddled with crime and destitution.
        The Pit has a notorious link to the many crime families and gangs of Sector Twelve, as it’s a place for unwanted
        individuals and merchandise to "go missing".

        <h3>Potential Roleplaying Opportunities:</h3> The Five Points System is filled with untouched lands for outlaws
        to hide out on. Small outposts and settlements make up the homes of subsidiary farmers, braving the frontier
        life. Remnants of the Empire’s grasp can still be seen through abandoned infrastructure and military bases, and
        the ever present Sapius Corporation can always be found on their storage world Athus. Should one travel to Kol
        Saka or The Pit, they'd see the stark differences of this system's frontier roots and the dark dealings
        civilization has brought.</p1>
