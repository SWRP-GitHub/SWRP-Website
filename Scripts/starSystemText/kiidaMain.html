        <h1>The Kiida System</h1>
        <h3>The Lost Star of the Daijax Nebula</h3>
        <p1>
            Within the Daijax Nebula sits one final star that’s too far within the maelstrom to be considered a part of
            the
            Andalu Cluster. This legendary system's very existence is doubted by many in Sector Twelve, a hidden cove
            nearly
            impossible to navigate to. The only way back and forth from the Kiida system is for a vessel to connect a
            Jedi
            Wayfinder to their navcomputer whilst in the Andalu Cluster.

            <h3>The Jedi Wayfinders:</h3> In 40 BBY, two Jedi led a voyage of religious pilgrims into the Andalu Cluster
            in
            search of a kyber-rich mountain devotees from the Church of the Force saw in visions. At that time, the only
            existing small settlements in Region Twelve were Marjora and Vaedas, making their journey into the unknown
            especially difficult. After navigating through the Andalu Cluster, Jedi Master Inus Daxio began the process
            of
            creating five total wayfinders that could be used as a compass to find the Kiida System, which was locked
            securely behind the edge of the Daijax Nebula. These small computers are cubical in shape, and resemble the
            framework of a Jedi holocron.

            <h3>Astral Bodies:</h3>
            <i>Kiida Prime:</i> The sole planet of the Kiida System, Kiida Prime is a gaseous world with bright gold
            clouds.
            <br><br>
            <i>The first moon of Kiida:</i> An inhospitable, desolate rock with low forces of gravity.
            <br><br>
            <i>The second moon of Kiida:</i> A wayward chunk of ice with no lifeforms of any kind.
            <br><br>
            <i>The third moon of Kiida:</i> A miniscule sandy moon, completely covered with shallow water. The
            unreliable
            atmosphere makes it so the stars and brilliantly colored nebula can always be seen displayed in the skies
            above.
            <br><br>
            <i>The fourth moon of Kiida:</i> A scarlet moon doused in clouds of blowing, powdery red dirt.
            <br><br>
            <i>The fifth moon of Kiida:</i> A blossoming moon with sprawling wood forests and delicate fields of exotic
            flowers. There are a host of small mammals native to this moon.
            <br><br>
            <i>The sixth moon of Kiida:</i> An inhospitable, battered ball of stone. Its elongated orbit spins it
            dangerously close to the nebula at its furthest point.
            <br><br>
            <i>The seventh moon of Kiida:</i> A mountainous moon with tall, sharp peaks clawing towards the sky. Lush
            green
            valleys can be found between the vast mountain ranges across the surface. The imposing Mount Matur has
            become a
            pilgrimage destination for many of the Jedi Wanderers.

            <h3>Mount Matur:</h3> In the Southern Hemisphere, less than six klicks out from Kiida VII’s largest sea,
            there's
            a particular mountain in which force attuned kyber crystals have formed. Mount Matur doesn’t particularly
            stand
            out from the other peaks in its range, but deep within it, the rare crystals make this distinct Mountain one
            of
            the most valuable sites in Sector Twelve, and the galaxy at large. Natural cave systems accessible near the
            peak
            lead those seeking a crystal to the center of the mountain, where a wide cavern full of a variety of
            naturally
            forming crystals can be discovered. Jedi chosen by a crystal will see it glowing distinctly from the others.

            The steep slope of the mountain not only makes for a tiring climb, it's also impossible to land anything
            larger
            than a small snubfighter anywhere near the summit.

            <h3>Sojourn:</h3> At the base of Mount Matur lies a small town, the only settlement within the Kiida System.
            The
            main structure of the town is what remains of the Sojourn, the vessel the members of the Church of the Force
            first used to travel to Kiida VII some time around 40 BBY. While portions of the vessel have been dismantled
            to
            expand the village housing, the main form of the ship is still recognizable, and is now used as the town
            hall.
            <br><br><i>Captain Pelluc:</i> The elderly female leader of the town of Sojourn and commander of the
            original
            voyage to the Kiida system almost fifty years ago.

            The religious pilgrims who now make up the Sojourn settlement sought to reside at the base of Mount Matur
            after
            witnessing the kyber mountain in shared visions. Due to the hardships of traveling in and out of the Kiida
            System, the town quickly became self-sufficient.

            Following the execution of Order 66 and the near destruction of the Jedi Order, Jedi duo Inus Daxio and
            Malic
            Tedronius would take it upon themselves to train a small group of padawans. The people of Sojourn swore to
            protect and care for any would be force sensitive wishing to follow the will of the force, so long as they
            swore
            to the ideology of the Jedi Order. Over the years, a number of would-be Jedi adepts eventually found their
            way
            to Kiida to train under the legendary Malic Tedronius, who once resided partway up the mountain.

            <h3>Potential Roleplaying Opportunities:</h3> The Kiida System represents an important step in any Jedi
            hopefuls
            journey to becoming an actual Jedi Knight, and to join the loose ranks of the Wandering Jedi who populate
            Region
            Twelve. The chance to build their own lightsaber. Should they manage to get their hands on one of the Jedi
            Wayfinders, and fly their way into the Kiida System, the kind members of the Church of the Force in the
            Sojourn
            Settlement are more than willing to offer any aid before one attempts to climb the mountain. Jedi are not
            the
            only ones who may be interested in the kyber holds within Mount Matur however, members of the Fragmented
            Sith
            seeking an end to the Wandering Jedi have long searched for the legendary mountain hidden behind the cloak
            of
            the Daijax Nebula. While most Sith have historically opted to kill a Jedi and bleed their kyber crystals
            red,
            some may seek the mountain for an additional source of kyber for other nefarious purposes.
